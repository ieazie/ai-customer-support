# Test Structure

- UI tests are always under `client/src/__tests__` directory.

# Test Coverage

- Test all critical business logic
- Aim for high test coverage in core functionality
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Test all edge cases and boundary conditions

# Test Organization

- Keep test close to implementation files
- Use descriptive test names but explain the behavior in the test
- Group related tests using the describe block
- Use beforeEach and afterEach for common setup/cleanup
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) in tests

# Testing Best Practices

- Write isolated tests that don't depend on each other
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use meaningful test data
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Keep tests maintainable and easy to read

# Testing Tools

- Use Jest as the test runner
- Use React Testing Library for UI/Component tests
- Use MSW for mocking API requests
- Use appropriate assertion libraries
- Run `npm test` after significant changes


# Integration Testing

- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Test component in interaction
- Test API integrations
- Test routing behaviour
- Test state management integration
- The development server is running separately
- Use logging for page test action
- Suppress human unreadable output in tests
