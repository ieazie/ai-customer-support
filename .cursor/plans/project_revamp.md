# Task Plan: Customer Support Initial Response Prompt

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Design the initial conversation prompt that handles customer inquiries, determines intent, and provides appropriate responses through the AI agent
- **Target Module**: server/src/modules/ai-agent
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Business Requirements
- Provide natural, conversational responses to customer inquiries
- Accurately identify customer intent and sentiment
- Handle both text and voice-based interactions
- Support seamless handoff to human agents when necessary
- Maintain conversation context across the session
- Support multilingual interactions (English and German)

## Technical Context
- **Current Implementation**: Integrates with AI-agent module through the call handler gateway
- **Related Components**: 
  - call-handler.gateway.ts
  - ai-agent.service.ts
  - TranscriptView.tsx
  - AudioPlayer.tsx
  - AudioRecorder.tsx
- **Dependencies**:
  - Speech-to-text service
  - Text-to-speech service
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Session management
  - WebSocket connection

## Prompt Design

### Input Parameters
- `customerInput`: {
    type: string,
    format: "text" | "audio_transcript",
    language: "en" | "de"
  }
- `sessionContext`: {
    sessionId: string,
    conversationHistory: Message[],
    customerMetadata: {
      language: string,
      previousInteractions: number,
      technicalLevel: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "expert"
    }
  }
- `sentiment`: {
    score: number,  // -1 to 1
    label: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative"
  }

### Knowledge Base Requirements
- Access to product/service documentation
- Common customer issues and resolutions
- Escalation triggers for human handoff
- Language-specific response templates
- Company policies and guidelines

### Response Structure
1. **Opening**: 
   - Acknowledge customer in their preferred language
   - Reference previous context if available
   - Show understanding of their inquiry

2. **Solution/Information**:
   - Structured, step-by-step responses
   - Include relevant documentation links
   - Provide code examples if technical
   - Offer alternative solutions when applicable

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Verify if the response addresses the inquiry
   - Ask for confirmation
   - Provide next steps or additional resources

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Handle frustrated customers with empathy
   - Escalate to human support when:
     - Sentiment is highly negative
     - Complex technical issues
     - Multiple failed resolution attempts
     - Explicit request for human agent

### Constraints
- **Length**: 2-3 paragraphs maximum per response
- **Tone**: Professional, empathetic, solution-oriented
- **Technical Level**: Adapt based on customer's expertise level
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Gracefully handle unclear inputs
  - Request clarification when needed
  - Maintain conversation flow

## Implementation Plan
1. **Create/Modify**:
   ```
   server/src/modules/ai-agent/
   ├── prompts/
   │   ├── initial-response.prompt.ts
   │   └── response-templates.ts
   ├── interfaces/
   │   ├── prompt-config.interface.ts
   │   └── response-structure.interface.ts
   └── services/
       └── prompt-manager.service.ts
   ```

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Connect with WebSocket gateway for real-time communication
   - Integrate with speech-to-text and text-to-speech services
   - Hook into sentiment analysis pipeline
   - Connect with session management system

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for prompt generation
   - Integration tests with AI service
   - End-to-end conversation flow tests
   - Multi-language response validation
   - Performance testing under load

4. **Rollout Plan**:
   - Initial testing in development environment
   - Beta testing with sample customer scenarios
   - Gradual rollout starting with English language
   - Monitor and adjust based on feedback
